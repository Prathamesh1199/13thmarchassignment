    "\n",
    "3.'Last observation carried forward (LOCF)': This method involves replacing missing values with the value of\n",
    "the last measurement that was observed. This can result in biased estimates of the treatment effect if the\n",
    "missing data are related to changes in the outcome over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.'Multiple imputation': This method involves creating multiple plausible values for each missing observation based\n",

    "and standard errors, while using LOCF can artificially reduce the variability in the data and also result in biased\n",
    "estimates of the treatment effect. Multiple imputation is generally considered the most robust method for handling\n",
    "missing data, but it requires careful consideration of the assumptions of the imputation model and can be computationally\n",
    "intensive. Ultimately, the choice of method for handling missing data in a repeated measures ANOVA should be based on the \n",
